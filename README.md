![HUB](img/logo_medium.png)

A raspberry pi compose stack for home automation.

## Features

- Home Assistant - used for home automation
- SWAG (Nginx Proxy Manager) - used for exposing services to the internet
- Portainer - **Isolated** - used for managing docker containers
- Watchtower - used for auto-updating docker containers
- WG-Easy (Wireguard) - used for VPN access to the network
- Speedtest Tracker - used for tracking internet speed

## Notes

- This stack is targeted for a Raspberry Pi, but can be used in any other system and adapted easily if needed.
- This stack assumes that you have a domain and a dynamic DNS service to update your IP address.
- Some features are optional and can be removed if you don't need them.
  - Speedtest Tracker - if you don't want to track your internet speed
  - SWAG - if you don't want to expose services to the internet
  - WG-Easy - if you don't want to access your network remotely via VPN
  - Watchtower - if you don't want to auto-update your containers
